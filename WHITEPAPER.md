# The Architect — Whitepaper

### AI-Powered Onboarding for the Stacks Ecosystem

**Version 1.1 | February 2026 | 3-Month Plan**

---

## 1. Problem

New users trying to join the Stacks ecosystem face three barriers:

1. **Too complicated** — Concepts like Proof of Transfer, Clarity smart contracts, and sBTC have no simple explanations aimed at everyday people.
2. **Information is everywhere** — Useful content is scattered across GitHub, Discord, Twitter, and blogs. There's no single place to learn.
3. **People leave** — Without guided help, most newcomers get overwhelmed and never come back.

**Bottom line:** Stacks has great technology, but not enough people understand it.

---

## 2. Proposed Solution

**The Architect** is an AI chatbot that teaches people about Stacks in plain, simple language.

- Ask any question → get a clear answer
- Pick a topic → follow a guided lesson
- Take a quiz → test what you learned
- See live data → real-time STX prices and network stats
- Browse dApps → discover what's built on Stacks

It works for beginners (even kids) and experienced users alike.
